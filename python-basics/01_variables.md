# Variables 



## 📘 Introduction 

A variable is a container used to store data in memory.



## 🧠 Syntax

```python

variable_name = value

```

## ✨ Rules for Creating Variables

### 1️ Must Start with a Letter or Underscore (_).

A variable name must begin with:
- A letter (a–z, A–Z)
- An underscore (_)
### Format
```python
name = "Harshitha"
_age = 21
  ```

## 2. Begining shouldn't start from numbers(0-1).

  it can start from anywhere living at the beginning.

### Format
```python
   1name="john" # cannot start from number 
    name_1="mary" # this is correct format
```
## 3. No space allowed( ) and no other special cases(@,$,%,^,&, etc)
 if we give the space between variable name then compiler throw SyntaxError.
 
### Format
```python
 user name ="john" # wrong syntax
 user_name1="john" # correct
```



## 4.Python is case sensitive
python make difference between uppercase and lowercase letters

```python
 user_name ="john" #difference
 User_name1="mary"
```

# 📦 Data Types in Python

## 📘 Introduction to Data types

Data type says what type of data can the variable stores.In python has built-in data types.

---

# Types of Data type:

## 1. Numeric Types
- **int**: Stores whole number,positive or negative without decimal (eg:7,-45 etc)
  
```python
   num=23
   num1=-89

```
- **float**: It stores number with decimal form.(eg-3.14,-0.0007)
  
```python
 num=23.899999
 num1=-89.6789
```


##  2. Sequence Types
- **str** : it stores the value of (letter,number,symboles) but it should be quote either in single quote('') or double("")
```python
   value_alp ='hello, world'
   value_2alp = "Hello,world"
   value_num = "45"
   value_sym = "**"
```
- **list** : List is used to store different data type. it is stored in ( [ ] ).
  ```python
    value_list=["aman",23,78.99]
  ```
- **tuple** : it is type of list but data are store in ( ( ) )
     ```python
      value_tuple = ("dance",89,89.00)
  ```

## 3.Mapping & Set Types
- **set** : it stores data where nothing repeats and it is not in specific order. it is stored in ( { } ).
   ```python
         value_set = {"dance",89,89.00}
    ```
- **dict** : Dictionary stores the data in {key : value} pairs. it is stored in( { } ).
 ```python
 value_dict ={
     "name":"jon",
     "age":20
            }
  ```


## 4. Boolean type
- **bool** : it is simple data type which represent concept of logici and it as only 2 value  True or False.
     ```python
       x = 10
       y = 5

     print(x > y)   # True (Greater than)
     print(x == y)  # False (Equal to)
     print(x != y) # True (x is not equal to y)
            
  ```
